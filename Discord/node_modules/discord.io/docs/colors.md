There are two ways to set role colors with this lib.

The first method allows you to provide any color you want, as a Number. I recommend using Hex numbers as this maps easily to HTML color codes. Assuming you want to use the color `#F35353`, you can just use `0xF35353`

```js
bot.editRole({
	color: 0xF35353
});
```

The second method is providing the name of one of the official colors Discord has on its picker. The name you type will map to one of the colors below.
```javascript
bot.editRole({
	color: "RED"
});
```

Official color list:
```javascript
